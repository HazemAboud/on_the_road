On The Road: Fuel Cost Estimator

This app is used to calculate the estimated cost of your trip based on distance, fuel efficiency of the car, and fuel price.

Process:

1) The user inputs distance (miles or km), efficiency (km/l or mile/l), and price (RM/L).
2) Verify that the input is numerical and greater than 0, then calculate the cost using the formula distance/efficiency * price.
3) Display the cost as text below the calculate button. 

Widgets:

1-AppBar

2-Center

3-SingleChildScrollView

4-SizedBox

5-Column

6-Row

7-Padding

8-TextField

9-InputDecoration

10-DropdownButton

11-Text

12-ElevatedButton

13-Container

Validation: The application was tested with multiple input combinations, eg.

1) all missing
2) Only the distance is input correctly
3) Price and distance are entered correctly
4) Efficiency is entered as 0
5) All values are entered correctly
   
Additionally, I used the Fuel Cost Calculator online to confirm that results and unit conversion were calculated correctly.
